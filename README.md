# Portfolio
Overview
- In this project, I revisited my early responsive portfolio from the beginning of bootcamp and polished it by adding improved css elements.
Languages Used
- HTML and CSS

Tools Used
- Bootstrap

Challenges
- A challenge that this project presented me with was how to re-design my earlier vanilla websites. This problem led to a rabbit hole of issues linked to using Bootstrap and targeting the HTML elements I wanted to style. I was able to overcome this challenge by re-reading the Bootstrap documentation and playing around with my HTML and CSS until it looked presentable.
